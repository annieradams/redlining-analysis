# Environmental Factor's relationship with Redlined Communities

This repo dives into how historical implementations of redlining effects different environmental factors wtihin redlined districts. We will first explore historical redlined districts by mapping different communities to their HOLC grade. For each of these different HOLC grades, we will explore hpow/if PM 2.5, low life expectancy, and air toxics cancer risk are disproptionate based on their HOLC grade. The final environmnetal sector we will explore within redlining will be birdwatching. We will explore the number of birds reported by citizens within each HOLC grade to see their relationship.
